    <h1>About me!</h1>

        Hello there, everyone! <b>Rafael Jimenez</b> is my name, and I am currently a software engineering major. This
        is my second semester at this university. I came from the University of Maryland and transferred here. I'm still
        getting used to living in a tiny town. Honestly not sure if I can ever adjust but looking forward to the future.
    </p>

        I never imagined I'd wind up in Idaho, especially since I'm not a church member. It's amusing to consider now that
        I'm here. I transferred from a large party school to a small one, which helped me turn my life around. It was a
        Sunday when I initially arrived. I went to get some lunch because I was hungry, but nothing was open. I was unhappy,
        but it has helped me get back in shape now that time has passed.
    </p>

        The most striking thing I've observed is how nice everyone is. Because I grew up in a difficult neighborhood, I
        occasionally cry about it. Kindness aids in the development of the heart!
    </p>

    <h2>Finally!!!</h2>
    <p>I got accepted to my dream school the University of Miami! Still not sure what to do, but I know with prayer 
        I will figure it out.
